# CS50 Python

Welcome to my repository for **Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Python** problem sets.

## Why I Created This Repository

I aspire to become highly proficient at solving **scientific problems related to Longevity** through coding. However, I realized that I needed to strengthen my foundational knowledge in programming. To address this, I decided to learn from one of the best Computer Science courses available: **CS50 by Harvard**.

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from the **CS50 Python course**. Each solution reflects my learning process as I work toward mastering the basics of Python programming.

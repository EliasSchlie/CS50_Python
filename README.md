Harvards CS50 introduction to python problem sets

I want to become extremely good at solving scientific problems of Longevity using code.
The problem is that I realized, that I am missing most of the basics.
So I decided to learn them with the best Computer Science courses I could find: "CS50 Harvard"

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets of the CS50 Python course
